"""Mira as an ADK agent with abilities (EP3): tools + ONE policy door.

Same persona, same tools as EP1's raw build — but expressed the framework way:
an `Agent` with plain-function tools. The Runner + LiveRequestQueue + run_live
(in adk_server.py) replace EP1's two hand-rolled asyncio tasks and the per-turn
receive() loop.
